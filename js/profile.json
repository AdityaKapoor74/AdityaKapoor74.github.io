  "summary": "<p>I have always been fascinated by the idea of bringing an otherwise inanimate and unintelligent system to life by adding an electronic brain. If machines could be endowed with humans’ ability to adapt and learn quickly, the resultant products can be used to perform any activity by using human-like intelligence but circumventing their low physical and mental resilience. To learn to program such intelligent robots, I did my Bachelors in Computer Science at BITS Pilani (Goa). At the university, with guidance from my professors and seniors, I explored how mimicking human modes of learning on robotic platforms can help researchers better understand cognitive systems and work towards developing truly intelligent machines. Intrigued by the advancements in human-inspired robotics, I have focused most of my studies on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>",
