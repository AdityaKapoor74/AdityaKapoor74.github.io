  "summary": "<p>I have always been fascinated by the idea of bringing an otherwise inanimate and unintelligent system to life by adding an electronic brain. If machines could be endowed with humansâ€™ ability to adapt and learn quickly, the resultant products can be used to perform any activity by using human-like intelligence but circumventing their low physical and mental resilience. To learn to program such intelligent robots, I did my Bachelors in Computer Science at BITS Pilani (Goa). At the university, with guidance from my professors and seniors, I explored how mimicking human modes of learning on robotic platforms can help researchers better understand cognitive systems and work towards developing truly intelligent machines. Intrigued by the advancements in human-inspired robotics, I have focused most of my studies on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>",
